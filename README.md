# 3G-Wireless-System 
This Is the code for sending temperature data wirelessly using the tiny sine 3g shield. 
This code uses a modified version of the adafruit fona library. It also uses the Arduino-Temperature-Control-Library-master 
from miles burton and the OneWire library by Paul Stoffregen. This file includes the code for the 3G wireless sensor system for the 
TMP 36 and DS18B20 sensors.
